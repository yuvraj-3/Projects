# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Project Repository!

Hey there! This is my personal project space where I explore machine learning, AI, and data-driven applications using Python and Streamlit.

Inside this repo, youâ€™ll find two of my key projects:

---

## ðŸŽ¬ 1. Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning-based engine that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

**Highlights:**
- Uses collaborative and content-based filtering
- Built with `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`

ðŸ”— **[Open Project](./Movie%20Recommendation%20System)**

## ðŸ§  2. Cinevo-AI: Object Detection App

A Streamlit-powered web app for detecting objects in images and videos using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models.

**Highlights:**
- Upload images/videos or use your webcam for real-time detection
- Built using `Streamlit`, `OpenCV`, `PyTorch`, `Ultralytics`, `Pillow`
